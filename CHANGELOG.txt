Author: 		Jack Anderson

Version 3.0 DEV 2 - 2012-07-10
Change author: Joel Etherton
----------------------------------------
Removed option "panel_clickable". Added option "clickable" as a string to specify which items respond to the item link.

New options:
	- clickable
		- STRING: specifies which element responds to the item link. Valid options: all|panel|overlay|none

Usage-script:

        $(function () {
            $('#myGallery').galleryView({
                clickable: 'all'
            });
        });

Version 3.0 DEV 2 - 2012-06-26
Change author: Joel Etherton
----------------------------------------
Added a new option to allow for the primary panel image to display in a random order while the "slideshow" is playing.
Also modified the showNext method to perform the randomness while the playing flag is set.

New option:
	 - play_random_order
		- BOOLEAN: flag to indicate that the slideshow should be random

Usage-script:

        $(function () {
            $('#myGallery').galleryView({
                play_random_order: true
            });
        });


Version 3.0 DEV 2 - 2012-06-26
Change author: Joel Etherton
----------------------------------------
Added image linking directly for the panel. Added 2 options to support this linking (described below).
The panel itself becomes a clickable link which can redirect to any url specified in the data-href attribute
of the original image html.

New options:
	- panel_clickable
		- BOOLEAN: flag to indicate that the panel should have a clickable link
	- link_newwindow
		- BOOLEAN: flag to indicate that panel links should/should not open in a new window

Usage-script:

        $(function () {
            $('#myGallery').galleryView({
                panel_clickable: true,
                link_newwindow: false
            });
        });

Usage-html:

        <li><img src="myImage.jpg" data-href="http://www.google.com/" />

There are many more options that probably should be available, but this provides baseline functionality.

Anchor tags in source markup now transfer to both the filmstrip and the panel
Fixed bug preventing filmstrip from stretching full width of gallery when 'show_filmstrip_nav' option was set to false
Enabled ability to show all frames and filmstrip navigation together
Added new option to control display of panel overlays
Classes applied to the source <li> tags will be copied to both the appropriate filmstrip frame and panel
Classes applied to the source <ul> tag will be copied to the resulting gallery <div>

New options:
	- show_overlays
		- BOOLEAN: flag to indicate whether to show or hide panel overlays

Version 3.0 beta 2 - 2011-03-14
----------------------------------------
Class names altered to be less generic, avoid interference from other CSS
Removed fixed caption size, added CSS support for multi-line captions
Added 'filter:inherit' CSS rule to panels to combat IE8 which prevents fade animations from working
Changed navigation images to <div> tags with images as backgrounds. Navigation images can now be defined in CSS

Removed options:
	- nav_theme
		- no longer necessary as navigation images are defined in CSS
	- theme_format
		- no longer necessary as navigation images are defined in CSS
		

Version 3.0 beta 1 - 2011-03-10
----------------------------------------
Setting transition interval to 0 prevents automated transitions instead of causing instant transitions
Capped transition speed at value of transition interval to prevent overlapping animations
Changed default panel_scale value from 'nocrop' to 'crop'
Capped pointer size to 1/2 of frame width to prevent pointer from extending past frame edge
Fixed bug that caused misplaced panels when not displaying filmstrip

Various bug fixes regarding incorrect element placement after customizing CSS
Improved gallery loading behavior (users no longer see gallery animating to initial panel/frame)
Updated navigation themes to PNG format and included PNG support for custom navigation themes
Made both panel and filmstrip navigation optional, regardless of panel and filmstrip visibility
Panel navigation overlay images are now set to be opaque due to an IE7 PNG transparency bug. You can create your own transparent overlay images if you wish

New options:
	- filmstrip_style
		- STRING: Sets behavior of filmstrip (scroll,show all)
			- 'show all' forces 'show_navigation' to false and 'pointer_size' to zero (if there are 
			  multiple rows of frames)
	- show_panel_nav
		- BOOLEAN: flag to indicate whether to display panel-based navigation buttons
	- show_filmstrip_nav
		- BOOLEAN: flag to indicate whether to display filmstrip-based navigation buttons
	- animate_pointer
		- BOOLEAN: flag to indicate whether filmstrip pointer animates between frames or jumps instantly
	- panel_animation

	- theme_format
		- STRING: extension type of images in the theme indicated by the 'nav_theme' option

Removed options:

		- no longer necessary as setting panel_animation to 'none' serves the same purpose
