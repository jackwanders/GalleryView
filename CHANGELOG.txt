Anchor tags in source markup now transfer to both the filmstrip and the panel
Fixed bug preventing filmstrip from stretching full width of gallery when 'show_filmstrip_nav' option was set to false
Enabled ability to show all frames and filmstrip navigation together
Added new option to control display of panel overlays
Classes applied to the source <li> tags will be copied to both the appropriate filmstrip frame and panel
Classes applied to the source <ul> tag will be copied to the resulting gallery <div>

New options:
	- show_overlays
		- BOOLEAN: flag to indicate whether to show or hide panel overlays

Version 3.0 beta 2 - 2011-03-14
----------------------------------------
Class names altered to be less generic, avoid interference from other CSS
Removed fixed caption size, added CSS support for multi-line captions
Added 'filter:inherit' CSS rule to panels to combat IE8 which prevents fade animations from working
Changed navigation images to <div> tags with images as backgrounds. Navigation images can now be defined in CSS

	- nav_theme
		- no longer necessary as navigation images are defined in CSS
	- theme_format
		- no longer necessary as navigation images are defined in CSS
		

Version 3.0 beta 1 - 2011-03-10
----------------------------------------
Setting transition interval to 0 prevents automated transitions instead of causing instant transitions
Capped transition speed at value of transition interval to prevent overlapping animations
Changed default panel_scale value from 'nocrop' to 'crop'
Capped pointer size to 1/2 of frame width to prevent pointer from extending past frame edge
Fixed bug that caused misplaced panels when not displaying filmstrip
Fixed bug when calling plugin after window load
Added ability to slide panels as an alternative to fading
Various bug fixes regarding incorrect element placement after customizing CSS
Improved gallery loading behavior (users no longer see gallery animating to initial panel/frame)
Updated navigation themes to PNG format and included PNG support for custom navigation themes
Made both panel and filmstrip navigation optional, regardless of panel and filmstrip visibility
Panel navigation overlay images are now set to be opaque due to an IE7 PNG transparency bug. You can create your own transparent overlay images if you wish

New options:
	- filmstrip_style
		- STRING: Sets behavior of filmstrip (scroll,show all)
			- 'show all' forces 'show_navigation' to false and 'pointer_size' to zero (if there are 
			  multiple rows of frames)
	- show_panel_nav
		- BOOLEAN: flag to indicate whether to display panel-based navigation buttons
	- show_filmstrip_nav
		- BOOLEAN: flag to indicate whether to display filmstrip-based navigation buttons
	- animate_pointer
		- BOOLEAN: flag to indicate whether filmstrip pointer animates between frames or jumps instantly
	- panel_animation
		- STRING: type of transition panels should undergo (fade,crossfade,slide,zoom,none)
	- theme_format
		- STRING: extension type of images in the theme indicated by the 'nav_theme' option

Removed options:
	- fade_panels
		- no longer necessary as setting panel_animation to 'none' serves the same purpose
